## About the Stormwater COI

The Industrial Stormwater Community of Interest (ISCOI) is a partnership of people whose objective it is help reduce stormwater pollution. ISCOI partners include individuals from a diverse group of organizations, businesses, and agencies that are located in the Puyallup River Watershed, Pierce County and City of Tacoma. The ISCOI leverages decades of work that have been done by our partners, their projects and programs dedicated to improving the quality of industrial stormwater. We are proud to bring together these dedicated professionals to help tackle the complexities of industrial stormwater and there is always room at the table for more partners and community input. Additional information on ISCOI partners is provided here.  See Section 5 for more textâ€¦.
