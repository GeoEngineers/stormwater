## Regulatory Assistance

What are the requirements that apply to stormwater from my industrial activities?

Identifying the requirements that apply to stormwater discharging from facilities performing industrial activities in the Tideflats can be confusing because it depends on multiple factors including location and type of activity and can be administered by multiple entities including the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), City of Tacoma (City), Port of Tacoma (Port), and the Puyallup Tribe.
