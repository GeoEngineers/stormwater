Industrial activities that are required to obtain coverage under one of these permits are defined by Ecology as:

<!-- - The 10 categories of industrial activities identified in federal regulation [40 CFR122.26(b)(14)(i-ix and xi)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title40-vol24/pdf/CFR-2017-title40-vol24-part122.pdf#page=53); -->
