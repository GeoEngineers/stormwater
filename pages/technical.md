## Technical Assistance

Any business can make changes at their site to help manage stormwater pollution, even if they aren’t required to as part of a permit. It can be as simple as reminding your staff to avoid putting anything but clean rainwater down storm drains, or something more complex like installing a rain garden. But how do you know what is right for your site? The Industrial Stormwater COI is helping local businesses of all types and sizes learn how they can manage the stormwater that flows through their properties.

There are many different types of businesses in Tacoma’s industrial areas that provide products and services that are vital to our way of life. It can be very challenging for these types of businesses to meet strict environmental regulations due to the nature of their operations. These case studies were created to showcase the stormwater management efforts put forth by our community members, and to take a look at how the technologies used are working for them.
