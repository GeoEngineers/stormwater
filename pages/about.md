    The Industrial Stormwater Community of Interest (ISCOI) is a collaborative group working to reduce stormwater pollution. ISCOI partners include individuals from a diverse group of organizations, businesses, and agencies located in the Puyallup River Watershed and the City of Tacoma. There is always room at the table for more partners and community input. Please send us an email or come to an ISCOI event if you want to take part in the COI.

    The ISCOI is currently focusing outreach activities on Tacoma’s industrial Tideflats area. The Tacoma Tideflats is our starting point because it is a small area with a high concentration of industrial businesses. The ISCOI plans to expand our outreach into the Nalley Valley industrial corridor as we move out into the rest of the Watershed. Although our outreach focus is in the Tideflats, we are here to support businesses all across the watershed.

    ### A Little History of the Tacoma Tideflats

    Historically, the Tacoma Tideflats area was an estuary that performed functions that improved water quality. However, over the more than a century of industrial use, most of the Tideflats has been filled and largely covered with impervious surfaces.

    Historic filling and discharges of industrial chemicals has taken its toll causing contamination of soil, groundwater and sediment. As a result the Tacoma Tideflats is within the Commencement Bay Nearshore/Tideflats Superfund Site which was established in 1983. Cleanup actions within the Superfund Site have largely been completed and are being monitored for effectiveness. Discharges of contaminated stormwater have the potential to re-contaminate sites that have been cleaned up. Additional information concerning the Commencement Bay Superfund Site is provided [here.](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/csitinfo.cfm?id=1000981) See how the Tideflats changed from the late 1800’s to the present scrolling down through the pictorial provided [here](https://wa-sw-ctr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=767eb51aff884d1594542cdc5c52785e).

  partners_copy: Our work leverages the decades of work that have been done by our partners, their projects and programs dedicated to improving the quality of industrial stormwater. We are proud to bring together these dedicated professionals to help tackle the complexities of industrial stormwater; and there is always room at the table for more community input and partners.
  strategies_lead: The ISCOI is working on tiered strategies to address water quality from different aspects. We are focused on permitted business, non-permitted and commercial businesses and community impacts.

    ### The ISCOI is working to address stormwater pollution in several ways. We are focused on businesses, government and community partnerships.
    Some industrial businesses are regulated for their stormwater runoff under the Department of Ecology’s NPDES permit program. Non-permitted businesses are still required to take steps to prevent pollution by the city or county they're located in.  While many businesses in the area do a great job with their stormwater management, some businesses have barriers to overcome. The ISCOI is working to help businesses tackle those barriers and help promote the unsung compliance heroes working to keep Commencement Bay and the watershed clean.
    The ISCOI is working with agencies within the watershed to help bring attention to the needs and experiences of businesses. And something else.
    We know that we are not the first group of people setting out to address stormwater concerns in our community. The ISCOI is working to identify other groups that we can support or collaborate with to magnify our impact.
    ### Businesses
    ### Municipal/Government Partnerships
    ### Community Partnerships
