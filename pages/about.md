    The Stormwater Community of Interest (SCOI) is a collaborative group working to reduce stormwater pollution. SCOI partners include individuals from a diverse group of organizations, businesses, and agencies located in the Puyallup River Watershed and the City of Tacoma. There is always room at the table for more partners and community input.

    The SCOI initially focused on Tacomaâ€™s industrial Tideflats area due to the concentration of industrial businesses and the pioneering environmental programs of the City of Tacoma and Port of Tacoma. We have expanded to support industrial and commercial businesses throughout the Puyallup River Watershed using tools developed in these early efforts.

    Polluted stormwater runoff is the number one threat to Puget Sound.  To better respond to water quality and community need in the watershed the SCOI will be working to expand programming to include residential and community stormwater concerns.  New programming will break down barriers for community members to take action in their daily lives to protect Puget Sound.

    Historically the Tacoma Tideflats area was an estuary that performed functions that improved water quality. However, over the more than a century of industrial use, most of the Tideflats has been filled and largely covered with impervious surfaces.
