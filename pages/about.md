  main_copy: The Industrial Stormwater Community of Interest (ISCOI) is a partnership of people whose objective it is help reduce stormwater pollution. ISCOI partners include individuals from a diverse group of organizations, businesses, and agencies that are located in the Puyallup River Watershed, Pierce County and City of Tacoma. The ISCOI leverages decades of work that have been done by our partners, their projects and programs dedicated to improving the quality of industrial stormwater. We are proud to bring together these dedicated professionals to help tackle the complexities of industrial stormwater and there is always room at the table for more partners and community input. Additional information on ISCOI partners is provided here.  See Section 5 for more textâ€¦.

    ### Permitted businesses
    Permitted businesses are regulated for their stormwater runoff under the Department of Ecology's NPDES permit program. While many businesses in the area do a great job with their permit compliance, some businesses have barriers to overcome. The ISCOI is working to help businesses tackle those barriers and help promote the unsung compliance heroes working to keep Commencement Bay and the watershed clean. We are also working to enable those businesses that need a permit to more easily implement and understand it.
    ### Non-permitted and Commercial businesses
    Not every business needs or has an NPDES permit for stormwater runoff, but every business is a steward of our community and local environment. We are working to highlight existing programs and incentives offered through municipalities and to work with businesses to explore developing new incentives to encourage businesses to become stronger environmental stewards.
    ### Community Engagement
    Everyone is responsible for the health of our waterways. Some people assume that only factories and big industrial companies contribute to water pollution. That is simply not true. Every day actions can have a cumulative, negative impact on our water quality. We will partner with existing programs and other COIs to bring about watershed-wide change.
