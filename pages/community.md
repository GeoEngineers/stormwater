## Community Action

It’s easy to assume that only factories and big industrial companies contribute to water pollution. But in fact, everyday actions like driving your car or walking your dog, can have a cumulative, negative impact on our water quality. That’s why it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the health of our waterways.

SCOI will partner with existing programs such as Puget Sound Starts Here and other Communities of Interest within the Puyallup Watershed Initiative to bring about widespread and sustainable improvements. Our members are available to speak to neighborhood councils, community groups and at any other gatherings about the importance of stormwater management and how local residents can contribute.

For more information, please contact: Carrie Hernandez [chernandez@pwi.org](mailto:chernandez@pwi.org).

> One of the simplest things you can do to keep Puget Sound clean is to pick up after your pet. Pet waste contains bacteria that is harmful to fish, other aquatic organisms, and humans. During rain events that bacteria gets carried into local streams and Puget Sound.
