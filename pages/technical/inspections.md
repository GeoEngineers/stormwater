## Inspections

A qualified personnel from your facility must complete a visual inspection of your facility monthly. You must record the results of each inspection in an inspection report and keep the report on-site as part of your SWPPP. Ecology has prepared a [Monthly Inspection Form](https://ecology.wa.gov/Asset-Collections/Doc-Assets/Water-quality/Water-Quality-Permits/Industrial-Stormwater/Industrial-Stormwater-Monthly-Site-Inspection-Form) for you to use to ensure your inspections comply with the ISGP.
