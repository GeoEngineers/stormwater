## Inspections

A qualified personnel from your facility must complete a visual inspection of your facility monthly. You must record the results of each inspection in an inspection report and keep the report on-site as part of your SWPPP. Ecology has prepared a Monthly Inspection Form for you to use to ensure your inspections comply with the ISGP.
