## Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan

<div class='row'>
	<div class='col-xs-12 col-md-9'>
		<p>A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) is a core requirement of the Industrial Stormwater General Permit. It is a site-specific document that you prepare, outlining potential sources of stormwater pollution and describing best management practices your facility will employ to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges from your facility.</p>

		<p>Ecology has developed a <a href='https://ecology.wa.gov/Asset-Collections/Doc-Assets/Water-quality/Water-Quality-Permits/Industrial-Stormwater/Industrial-Stormwater-Pollution-Prevention-Plan-Te'>template</a> and a <a href='https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/documents/0410030.pdf'>guidance manual [PDF]</a> to help you develop a SWPPP that is consistent with the ISGP.</p>

		<p>An accurate site map is a crucial element to a SWPPP, and your permit outlines the elements that need to be identified on your site map. The SCOI has developed an <a href='https://wa-sw-ctr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=38162067e5d9447e84093add9389e25e'>interactive mapping tool</a> to help you prepare your site map.</p>
