## Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan

A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) is a core requirement of the Industrial Stormwater General Permit. It is a site-specific document that you prepare, outlining potential sources of stormwater pollution and describing best management practices your facility will employ to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges from your facility.

Ecology has developed a [template](https://ecology.wa.gov/Asset-Collections/Doc-Assets/Water-quality/Water-Quality-Permits/Industrial-Stormwater/Industrial-Stormwater-Pollution-Prevention-Plan-Te) and a [guidance manual [PDF]](https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/documents/0410030.pdf) to help you develop a SWPPP that is consistent with the ISGP.

An accurate site map is a crucial element to a SWPPP, and your permit outlines the elements that need to be identified on your site map. The SCOI has developed an [interactive mapping tool](https://wa-sw-ctr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=38162067e5d9447e84093add9389e25e) to help you prepare your site map.
