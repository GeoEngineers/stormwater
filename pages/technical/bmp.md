## Best Management Practices

Best Management Practices (BMPs) for stormwater consist of activities, procedures, or structures to prevent or reduce pollution in stormwater runoff. Some BMPs may be mandatory, depending on type of facility, while others are required if a facility is not in compliance with their permit. However no matter the business type or permit status, BMPs are recommended for all facilities to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff from their site. Most BMPs can be grouped in to three categories:

- **Operational Source Control BMPs** are practices that prevent or reduce pollutants from entering stormwater. Examples include good housekeeping practices, employee training, spill prevention and clean up, and cleaning catch basins and other stormwater facilities regularly. These BMP types can be the most cost-effective since it is easier and cheaper to keep pollutants out of your stormwater than it is to remove pollutants from the stormwater.
- **Structural Source Control BMPs** are physical, structural, or mechanical devices or structures that prevent pollutants from entering stormwater. Examples include keeping a pollutant source inside or under cover or constructing a berm or curb to divert run-off and/or run-on.
- **Treatment BMPs** are structures that remove pollutants from stormwater runoff through physical, chemical, or biological treatment mechanisms. Examples include oil/water separators, detention vaults, or biofiltration swales. These BMPs often apply to particular pollutant types, such as turbidity or dissolved zinc, or pollutant sources, such as fueling stations or rail yards.
