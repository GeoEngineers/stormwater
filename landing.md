## Industrial Stormwater

![fish_icon]()

Stormwater is the number one pollution source in Puget Sound. Each year, the Puget Sound basin receives an average of more than 370 billion gallons of stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, such as roadways, urban spaces, and industrial facilities.
The stormwater canâ€™t penetrate these surfaces and soak into the ground; so it flows across the surfaces and gets contaminated along the way with pollutants such as motor oil, metals including copper and zinc, and industrial chemicals. Approximately 30 tons of pollutants end up in the Puget Sound ecosystem every day.

The Industrial Stormwater Community of Interest (ISCOI) is a partnership of people whose objective it is help reduce stormwater pollution from industrial activities by providing support to industrial facilities working to meet challenging stormwater requirements. The ISCOI provides support through regulatory and technical assistance and community outreach. Our long-term goal is to improve water quality in the Puyallup River Watershed, starting in the Tacoma Tideflats and expanding into South Tacoma/Nalley Valley.
