## Regulatory Assistance

What are the requirements that apply to stormwater from my industrial activities?

Identifying the requirements that apply to stormwater discharging from facilities performing industrial activities in the Tideflats can be confusing because it depends on multiple factors including location and type of activity and can be administered by multiple entities including the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), City of Tacoma (City), Port of Tacoma (Port), and the Puyallup Tribe.

### Ecology:
The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) is delegated by the USEPA as the state water pollution control agency to administer the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and wastewater discharge permits program for Washington State including permits for facilities performing industrial activities. Ecology's authority to implement industrial stormwater requirements comes from the Federal Clean Water Act and Washington State Water Pollution Control Act. Ecology has developed an industrial general stormwater permit as well as specific industrial stormwater permits for various types of facilities performing industrial activities. Additional information on Ecology’s industrial stormwater permits is provide [here](regulatory/ecology).

### City of Tacoma:
The City of Tacoma (City) implements stormwater management activities within the City boundaries in accordance it's NPDES Stormwater Permit for Phase I Municipalities (MS4) from Ecology. The City, as part of its permit activities, performs source control activities that includes industrial activities. Additional information on the City of Tacoma’s industrial stormwater requirements is provide [here](regulator/tacoma).

### Port of Tacoma:
The Port of Tacoma (Port) implements stormwater management activities on Port properties in accordance with A Phase I MS4 NPDES Permit. The Port is identified as a secondary permittee under the Phase I permit. Under the NPDES permit, the Port is responsible for complying with applicable requirements for the municipal separate storm sewers it owns or operates, including tenant-occupied properties.  Generally, industrial activities are performed on Port properties. The Port and some Port tenants also are also covered by Industrial Stormwater General Permits. Additional information on the Port of Tacoma’s industrial stormwater requirements is provide [here](regulator/port).
