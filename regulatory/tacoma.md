### City of Tacoma Industrial Stormwater Requirements

Facilities within the City of Tacoma, if they do not already have an Ecology permit, are subject to the requirements of the City’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit for industrial stormwater if the facilities perform industrial activities or are industrial sites. Industrial stormwater could be considered to include stormwater runoff from those facilities that are located in areas zoned industrial or those facilities with industrial activities based on the City of Tacoma’s definition of “Industrial Activities” and “Industrial Sites” in the Glossary of the Stormwater Management Manual (City of Tacoma, 2016). “Industrial activities” are defined by the City of Tacoma as:

- Material handling, transportation, or storage;
- Manufacturing;
- Maintenance;
- Treatment; or
- Disposal.

Areas with industrial activities include plant yards, access roads and rail lines used by carriers of raw materials, manufactured products, waste material, or by-products; material handling sites; refuse sites; sites used for the application or disposal of process waste waters; sites used for the storage and maintenance of material handling equipment; sites used for residual treatment, storage, or disposal; shipping and receiving areas; manufacturing buildings; storage areas for raw materials, and intermediate and finished products; and areas where industrial activity has taken place. City of Tacoma requirements for facilities that perform Industrial Activities or are an Industrial Site is provided here.
